## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. Email the security team
Send an email to: [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com)

### 3. Include the following information in your report:
- **Type of issue** (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability**
- **The number of line(s) of code involved**
- **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)**
- **Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it**

### 4. What to expect
- You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours
- We will investigate and provide updates
- We will work with you to fix the issue
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

2. **Enable two-factor authentication** if available
3. **Keep your browser updated** to the latest version
4. **Be cautious of phishing attempts**
5. **Log out** when using shared computers
6. **Report suspicious activity** immediately
